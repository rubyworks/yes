# Tag Specifier "Is"

The `is` schema, unlike all the others, is not so much a constraint as
it is a *specifier*. If is used to tell a parser that a node is to
be interpreted as if it has the given tag.

Given a schema with an `is` specifier:

    ---
    //name:
      is: '<tag:yes.com,2011:name>'

And a YAML document that has matching nodes:

    ---
    - name: Choo Choo Train

Then parsing of the YAML document with the schema should produce a
an enty of the given type.

    # todo

And no validation errors will occur.

    yes = YES::Lint.new(@schema)
    errors = yes.validate(@yaml)
    errors.assert.empty?

If given a YAML document that lacks a conforming node: 

    ---
    - name: ['not a string']

Then parsing the document will raise an error.

    errors = yes.validate(@yaml)
    errors.refute.empty?
